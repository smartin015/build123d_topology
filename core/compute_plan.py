Compute-backend selection: CPU / single GPU / multi-GPU / multi-process CPU.

This module is the single place that decides, for a given problem size (the
FEA's reduced DOF count), which array module and which parallelism to use. It
is identical in both editions (CPU-only and GPU); it only *asks* `backend`
what is available (``is_gpu_build``, ``gpu_usable``, ``gpu_device_count``) and
never imports Cu-Py itself, so it stays import-safe in the hosted CPU
edition.

Thresholds (chosen from measurement, not guesswork -- see paper/experiments):

  ndof <  GPU_DOF                -> plain CPU (numpy), all available cores.
  GPU_DOF <= ndof < MULTI_GPU_DOF -> single GPU if the GPU edition has one
                                     that passed its self-test, else CPU.
  ndof >= MULTI_GPU_DOF           -> split the matrix-free matvec across every
                                     visible GPU (GPU edition, >1 device),
                                     else across CPU worker processes if that
                                     is available and beneficial at this size,
                                     else falls back one rung at a time down
                                     to plain CPU.

Below GPU_DOF, a GPU is *not* used even if present and requested: kernel-
launch / host<->device transfer overhead dominates the actual compute at that
scale, so numpy on the CPU is faster in practice for the small grids typical
of the coarse SIMP levels. This module exists so that decision is made in one
place instead of being re-litigated at every call site.

MULTI_CPU uses the same DOF threshold as MULTI_GPU: multi-process CPU work
only pays for itself once there is enough element work per worker to amortize
the shared-memory hand-off/IPC cost every CG iteration; below that scale a
single process (with the BLAS thread pool sized to the machine) is both
simpler and faster.
